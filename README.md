Heart Rate Prediction - Deep Learning based Image Processing
Photoplethysmography is a heart rate monitoring technique used to estimate a personâ€™s heart
pulse by analyzing the light intensity changes as and when the blood volume changes with each
pump of the heart. The system uses wearable sensors that have light source and photodetectors
along with imaging rPPG to measure the heart rate. The main aim of this project is to implement
different deep-learning models for rPPG image processing and compare the results to find the
best among the given 4 models. This conclusion is obtained by performing a series of extensive
training and testing processes on all the 3 given deep-learning models and analyzing the
respective results.
